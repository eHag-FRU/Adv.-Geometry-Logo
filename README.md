# Adv.-Geometry-Logo
A project for advanced geometry that was orginally suppose to be hand drawn, but got permission to write code to draw a logo.

This project was made for high school advanced geometry. The original project asked for the student to draw an Olympic
logo for a country they choose and to include different geometric aspects (tangents on a circle, different angles, etc.)
I chose to do Japan, and asked the teacher if I could make a program to draw my logo instead of doing it by hand.
This was done in Python with the Turtle library. At this point, I had not had any experience with object oriented programing.
The code is messy, but I wanted to leave it in its original state.

Here is a Repl.it link to run and test the code: https://replit.com/@Casual_Tube/Olympic-Citiy-Logo
